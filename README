NOTE: The instructions detailed here are for the already working functions. I will keep it updated.

1. COMPILING

Just type "make" in the root directory. Binaries will show up inside it.

2. RUNNING THE M-SCRIPTS AND BINARIES

In the root directory execute the "run_octave.sh script and call functions as normal.
