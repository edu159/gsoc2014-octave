NOTE: The instructions detailed here are for the already working functions. I will keep it updated.

1. COMPILING

Just type "make" in the root directory. Binaries will show up inside it.

2. RUNNING THE M-SCRIPTS AND BINARIES

Go inside "benchmark" directory and run "run_octave.s" bash script. Inside octave 
type "benchmark". That will show the execution time. L, U and P are the matrices to explore after 
executing the algorithm. To change the function and matrix for testing open the "benchmark.m"
file and uncomment and comment lines as desired.
